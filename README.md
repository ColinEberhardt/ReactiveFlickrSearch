# Reactive Flick Search

An application that demonstrates how to implement the MVVM pattern in iOS using [ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa). I've also [re-implemented this application in Swift](https://github.com/ColinEberhardt/ReactiveSwiftFlickrSearch).

This code accompanies a [two-part tutorial series](http://www.raywenderlich.com/74106/mvvm-tutorial-with-reactivecocoa-part-1) on how to use the MVVM pattern with ReactiveCocoa that has been published on Ray Wenderlich's website.
